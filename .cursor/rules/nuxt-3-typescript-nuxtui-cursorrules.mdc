# Nuxt 3 TypeScript Nuxt UI Cursor Rules

You have extensive expertise in Vue 3, Nuxt 3, TypeScript, Node.js, Vite, Vue Router, Pinia, VueUse, Nuxt UI, Supabase and Tailwind CSS. You possess a deep knowledge of best practices and performance optimization techniques across these technologies.

## Architecture & "God Tier" Nuxt 3 Structure

### 1.1 Overview

Feature-Based Modules: organize by feature, placing pages, components, composables, and stores within each feature folder.

Nuxt 3 Layered Structure:
• ~/layers/ for reusable Nitro/Runtime layers
• ~/modules/ for custom Nuxt modules (e.g., auth, payments)
• ~/plugins/ for initialization of VueUse, Supabase, axios, etc.
• ~/composables/ for reusable client‑side logic (useXxx)
• ~/stores/ for Pinia stores, one per domain
• ~/pages/, ~/layouts/, ~/components/
• ~/server/ for server API routes and middleware
• ~/types/ for shared TypeScript interfaces

### 1.2 Core Patterns

Module Pattern: encapsulate domain features with a clear API surface.

Repository Pattern: abstract Supabase or other data sources behind interfaces.

Service Layer: plain functions handling business logic, used by composables and server routes.

Event Bus: use Pinia or a lightweight library like mitt for decoupled communication.

## Code Style & Structure

### 2.1 TypeScript & Typing

Always use TypeScript; prefer interfaces over types for extendability.

Avoid enum; use as const or mapped types for flexibility.

Place types in ~/types with clear naming (IUser, IFeatureFlag) and always check (but never edit) database.types.ts in ~/types.

### 2.2 Composition API

Use in all components.

Prioritize composable functions: create in ~/composables, named useXxx.

Avoid classes; favor pure functions and closures.

### 2.3 Declarative & Functional

Embrace immutability: treat props as readonly.

Use array methods (map, filter, reduce) over loops.

Extract reusable logic into composables or helpers to enforce DRY.

## Nuxt 3 Specifics & SEO

### 3.1 Auto-Imports & APIs

Leverage Nuxt's auto-imports: no manual imports for ref, computed, useState, useRouter.

Use server API routes (~/server/api/*.ts) for secure operations.

Access environment variables via useRuntimeConfig().

### 3.2 Color Mode & Theming

Use @nuxtjs/color-mode with useColorMode().

Define theme settings in app.config.ts (colors, typography, spacing).

### 3.3 SEO & Meta

Manage page metadata with useHead and useSeoMeta.

Generate sitemap via @nuxtjs/sitemap.

## Data Fetching Strategies

SSR with caching: useFetch with server: true, lazy: false.

Client-side event handlers: $fetch.

Complex logic / aggregated data: useAsyncData with server: false, lazy: true.

Handle cancellations with AbortController.

Always implement onError for user-friendly fallbacks.

## State Management

Use Pinia: one store per domain (~/stores/useUserStore.ts).

Strongly type state and actions; avoid any.

Prefer setup stores and pure getters.

## UI, Styling & Responsive Design

### 6.1 Components & Utilities

Use Nuxt UI + Tailwind CSS.

Mobile-first approach: breakpoints sm → md → lg → xl.

Standardize UI tokens: rounded-2xl, shadow-soft, consistent spacing scales.

### 6.2 Images & Icons

Optimize images with  / .

Use Nuxt Icons for adaptive SVGs.

## Security & Performance

### 7.1 Security Practices

Validate all inputs with Zod or io-ts.

Regularly scan dependencies (npm audit, Dependabot).

Enforce CSP, HSTS, and XSS protections via headers.

### 7.2 Performance Optimization

Lazy-load components with defineAsyncComponent.

Implement code-splitting and use  / .

Analyze bundles with nuxt-bundle-analyzer or rollup-plugin-visualizer.

Leverage CDN caching and enable Supabase RLS and IndexedDB caching on the client.

## Simplicity & File Management

### 8.1 File Size Guidelines

**Components**: Max 200 lines. If exceeding, decompose into smaller components or extract logic to composables.

**Composables**: Max 150 lines. Focus on single responsibility. Use multiple composables for complex features.

**Services/Repositories**: Max 300 lines. Split large services by domain or functionality.

**Type Files**: Max 100 types per file. Group related types, separate by feature when needed.

**Pages**: Max 250 lines. Extract complex logic to composables or components.

### 8.2 Avoiding Over-Engineering

**Start Simple**: Build for current needs, not hypothetical future requirements.

**YAGNI Principle**: You Aren't Gonna Need It - avoid premature abstractions.

**Prefer Composition over Complex Inheritance**: Use composables and mixins over deep class hierarchies.

**Limit Abstraction Layers**: Avoid repository pattern unless you switch data sources. Direct Supabase calls are often sufficient.

**Progressive Enhancement**: Add complexity incrementally as features mature.

### 8.3 Complexity Red Flags

**Too Many Types**: More than 5 interface variations for the same entity suggests over-abstraction.

**Deep Nesting**: More than 3 levels of component nesting or function calls.

**Repetitive Patterns**: If you're copying similar code 3+ times, extract to composable.

**Complex State Transitions**: More than 4-5 states usually indicates over-complexity.

**Unused Abstractions**: Delete code that serves no current purpose.

### 8.4 Refactoring Triggers

When a file exceeds size limits, apply these strategies:

**Extract Composables**: Move reusable logic to ~/composables/

**Split Components**: Create child components for distinct UI sections

**Create Utilities**: Move pure functions to ~/utils/

**Feature Modules**: Group related files in feature folders

**Service Decomposition**: Split services by subdomain (e.g., userAuth, userProfile)

## Best Practices Summary

These rules form the baseline for consistent, maintainable, and scalable code across our Nuxt 3 SaaS projects. Adapt as necessary, but always align with the core principles:

• **Simplicity First**: Prefer simple, readable code over clever abstractions
• **File Size Discipline**: Keep files focused and manageable
• **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, add complexity only when needed
• **Feature-Based Organization**: Group by business function, not technical layer
• **Composable-First**: Extract reusable logic to composables before creating complex services
